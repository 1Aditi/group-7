## Task: Create different schemas required for the test platform database

## @anishyekhande - anishyekhande@gmail.com
Task 1  - Information gathered related to the task assigned;What is a database schema and the system and environments required.
Task 2 - Researched more on the topic.Understand how the postgresql works and create an adaptive workable environment.
Task 3 - Learnt the various terminologies which are useful in developing the database like constraints,primary key,foreign key,cascading.
Task 4 - Moved on to the coding task of the schema in vscode along with postgresql.Created tables, assigned relevant primary keys and foreign keys to the columns according to 
         database diagram

- Task 1: Researched about my topic.Learned what is a database schema,how to create a database schema, enviroment requirements to create databases.
- Task 2: Learnt postgresql (as it us the required language),its basics and advanvanced topics like constarints,primary key ,foreign key,on delete and other topics required for the given problem statement 
- Task 3:Researched about the tables required to create a online test portal schema ,the relationships between these tables and the constarints
- Task 4:Started coding the database schema using postgresql in groom IDE. Created tables required in the schema,established foreign key relationship among different tables and added constaints to each and every individual column if required

Task 1: Information gathering related to my topic. Learned what is database schema, setted required environment and installed PostgreSQL on local device.

Task 2: PostgreSQL- Learned how to create and develope database in PostgreSQL. studied different concepts of PostgreSQL like creating schema, views, simple and complex queries, constraints, primary key, foreign key, and how to use them, and many other related topics for internship project.

Task 3: Theory reaserch about tables and schemas that were going to be needed, drew rough class diagram for database model.

Task 4: Started with coding phase in VSCode IDE using PostgreSQL. Started with simple essential table structures.

Task 5: Finalised the class diagram and worked on code according to it. Updated and completed the code with adding primary keys and foreignkey relationship with every tables and schemas.

- Created 7 tables
   - students
   - packages (a 'package' categorizes a set of 'quizzes' (or tests). eg: All the 'Python' related tests are stored with 'package_id' of Python package.)
   - quizzes
   - questions
   - question_options
   - student_answers
   - tests_given
- Built necessary relationships between the tables using Primary and Foreign keys to avoid redundant duplication of data leading to lesser consumption of space.
- Created the relations in a way which makes it easier to implement aggregation.
- Tested JOIN operations with different inputs for relations between all the tables.
